Welcome to the **Dart and Flutter Master Course 2024** repository. This course has been meticulously crafted to guide you from the basics of Dart programming to advanced Flutter concepts, structured in a practical and engaging way.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into four primary directories, each dedicated to different aspects of the course. Below is the structured layout of the repository:

DartAndFlutter-Master24/ 
                     ```│ 
                        ├── 01-DartProgramming 
                        ├── 02-FlutterPrimary 
                        ├── 03-FlutterSecondary 
                        └── All-Material```


### 1. `01-DartProgramming`

This directory contains all the practice exercises covered in class. Each topic is organized into its own folder to ensure clarity, with a progressive approach from **basic** to **advanced**. Additionally, you will find README files within these folders offering further explanation and insights on the topics.

### 2. `02-FlutterPrimary`

In this section, you'll find practice exercises focused on **front-end development** using Flutter. Each folder is named after the corresponding topic, and the **L1, L2, L3** series represents the lectures, following the exact sequence of how the course was conducted by our mentor, [Syed Muhammad Arsalan Shah](https://github.com/SyedMuhammadArsalanShah).

### 3. `03-FlutterSecondary`

This directory is dedicated to the **back-end** concepts in Flutter. The exercises here were completed post-class to solidify understanding of the core concepts. Each topic has been carefully documented and explained.

### 4. `All-Material`

The **All-Material** directory is an important resource that houses the following three sections:

1. **Assignments**  
   This section contains all the assignments assigned by [Syed Muhammad Arsalan Shah](https://github.com/SyedMuhammadArsalanShah). After completing each assignment, they were uploaded here. It is further divided into three subdirectories for better organization:
   - **Dart Assignments**
   - **FlutterPrimary Assignments**
   - **FlutterSecondary Assignments**
   
2. **Notes**  
   The notes section includes key points and summaries of important topics. The notes are designed to be concise yet informative, focusing only on critical aspects to avoid overwhelming the learner. Like assignments, it’s divided into:
   - **Dart Notes**
   - **FlutterPrimary Notes**
   - **FlutterSecondary Notes**
   
3. **Projects**  
   This section holds all the project work completed during the course. There are two main categories:
   - **Dart Projects** (Further divided into **Dynamic** and **HardCoded** subdirectories)
   - **Flutter Projects** (All Flutter projects, whether dynamic or hardcoded, are placed together in this directory)
